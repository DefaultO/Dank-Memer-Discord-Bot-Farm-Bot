# Dank-Memer-Discord-Bot-Farm-Bot
Using the [Anarchy Framework](https://github.com/not-ilinked/Anarchy) for Discord Selfbots, I've coded a simple logic together that farms you some bot currency. The more alt accounts you have, the more you will profit from it. In something like 5 hours I've made **700.000+ ‚è£** with 1 Account only. Note that I have donator privilege and thus have to wait 10 seconds less than you between commands uses.
